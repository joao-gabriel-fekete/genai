# GenAI

## This is a program I have created to experiment with Generative AI.

#### I have used Python, Flask, PaLM 2 and AssemblyAi in order to create an application that would receive a Post request with an audio that would be transcripted and summarized.
#### The idea was not to have something production ready but rather to experiment with these tools and see how far I could take it. Things such as clean code, tests, and error handling were not taking into consideration.
#### On the other hand, the application was able to achieve considerably good results.
